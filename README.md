# github-battle
The result of my very first ReactJS basic course. The app runs a github battle game between 2 opponents.

##Steps of the battle
 1. Type player1 github name  
 2. Type player2 github name  
 3. Review the infos from the two players  
 4. Run the incredibly complex(??) algorithm and see who's the winner.  
 5. Start over  

## How to install
```
npm install
```

## How to run
```
npm start
```
and then open the browser at `http://localhost:8080`

## So what?
This is my very first experiment in learning with React following the lovely free basic course from
[@tylermcginnis33](http://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33).  
This app works with:

- JSX (stateless functional) components
- react-router
- axios
- react-addons-css-transition-group
- babel
- style,css loader
- webpack
